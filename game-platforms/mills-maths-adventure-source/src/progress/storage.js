/**
 * Persistence layer (Version 1: localStorage only).
 *
 * This file is the ONLY place that knows *where* progress is stored.
 * The rest of the app just calls loadProgress() / saveProgress().
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SWAPPING IN FIREBASE LATER:
 * Replace the bodies of loadProgress() and saveProgress() with Firestore
 * reads/writes (e.g. doc(db, "students", uid)). Because everything else
 * depends only on these two function signatures, no other file needs to
 * change. You may want to make them async and await them in the store.
