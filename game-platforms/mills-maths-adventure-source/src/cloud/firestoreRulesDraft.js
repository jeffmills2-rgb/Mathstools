/**
 * FIRESTORE RULES — Phase 3C compatibility DRAFT (the canonical source).
 *
 * This module holds the proposed rules as a STRING so the system checks can
 * verify their properties statically (no filesystem / no network). The identical
 * text is also written to `firestore.phase3c.compatibility.rules` for review and
 * manual deployment via the Firebase console/CLI.
 *
 * THESE RULES ARE NOT DEPLOYED FROM CODE. They are a reviewed draft. They are
 * SAFER than the current open rules but are NOT production-grade identity — see
 * RULES_LIMITATIONS. Anonymous auth + a typed studentCode/teacherCode is a
 * SHARED SECRET, not authentication. True scoping needs Cloud Functions +
 * custom claims (documented as Phase 3D / production).
